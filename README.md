# Titanic-Analysis
I did a project on Kaggle in which my objective was to predict how many people survived in the Titanic incident. Firstly, I analyzed the data, cleaned it and then applied various Machine learning algorithms on it out of which I got the maximum accuracy by applying SVM model and accuracy was about 80.38% on Kaggle. I did the project on Jupyter notebook using Python.
